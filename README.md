The following files are attached:
======================================

- 'README.txt'

- ‘run_analysis.R’: The R script which performs the five steps described in the project work. Essentially:

    —- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    —- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    —- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    —- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    —- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


- ‘tidydataset.txt’: The result of the R script on the data provided for the project
